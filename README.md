# MVNX Importer for Python
Simple library for importing MVNX files into Python, to access the data of a recording using XSense. Uses Python 3 and the untangle library.

## Creating a MVNX object
To import the data from a MVNX file and create a MVNX object in python, write the following line:

``` python
data=mvnx.MVNX('example.mvnx')
```
For an example of how to use the imported data inside python, take a look to the [example](https://github.com/BielColl/MVNX-importer-for-Python/blob/master/example.py). Also, for a closer inside in how to MVNX files are structured, I recommend to read [MVN Awinda User Manual](https://fccid.io/QILMTW2-3A7G6/User-Manual/Users-Manual-2695756).
